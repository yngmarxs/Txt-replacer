# txt-replacer
Basic program that changes the first x lines in a text file, and after that, looks through the textfile with set lines to be replaced.

for the program to work you need:
an input file (whatever.txt) in ./input/whatever.txt
an output folder ./output/ (is gonna be saved as whateverx.txt)
an config and a config folder (ProfileName.txt) in ./config/ProfileName.txt
the extensions are added in the program (all of them are txt)
